You can create a blank disk image with the command:

mkfs.msdos -C disk.img 100

where 100 is the size in KB

On some systems /mkfs.msdos is under /sbin directory. 
Afterwards you can mount it as loopback device with command:

sudo mkdir -p /media/mydisk
sudo mount -o loop,rw,sync ./disk.img /media/mydisk/

To unmount, use the command
sudo umount /media/mydisk/
