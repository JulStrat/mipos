Multum In Parvo Operating System is a cooperative multitasking RTOS designed for single-chip micro-controllers with severely limited RAM (e.g. less than 256 bytes) and ROM. It provides the flexibility of an RTOS in low-cost embedded designs.
System-On-Chip (SoC) programmers can choose mipOS for its small, fast and royalty-free benefits.

mipOS manages tasks, providing mutual exclusion, signals, message queues, memory management, malloc, memory pools, timers.
Optional modules include: command line support, file system and stdio support.

![mipOS Architecture](http://www.eantcal.eu/_/rsrc/1434877676414/home/c/mipos/miposarc.png)

mipOS is designed to be as compact as possible for the target architecture. Its small footprint enables use in devices with limited memory capacity, including on-chip in SoC implementations, and that reduces power demands, extending battery life.

Small size also makes mipOS easy to understand and use. Computer science students can enhance their understanding of a simple OS and gain valuable practical experience modifying it, for example introducing new features.

mipOS is highly portable: it is written mainly in C programming language.
mipOS is free for any use.

It is also royalty-free, ideal for applications with high-volume production needs.

mipOS is delivered in fully documented source code form. 

mipOS can be executed on Windows™ or Linux user-space process for simulation purposes (both Microsoft® Visual Studio™ and GCC compilers are supported).

The original design and the source code was published in an article for the magazine Computer Programming where the internals of a portable and scalable kernel for microcontrollers with severely limited resource are described.

mipOS has been tested on Intel x86 chip, STMicroelectronics® ST7 microcontrollers, STM8 microcontroller and STM32 32bit, ARM-Cortex M3 microcontroller families.
